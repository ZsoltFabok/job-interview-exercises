Hi,

If you are here, you are probably participating in one of my job interview sessions. I tend to start the job interviews with this easy project so that the candidate can learn more about the task he or she is supposed to do later on and I can learn more about the candidate: how she writes code how she communicates and how she solves problems. If you are a candidate, please read the following instructions and act accordingly.

Welcome and good luck!

## The task

The task is very simple: implement an application in Java or C++, which can do the following:

	echo "22 144" | name_of_your_application
	22  ->  XXII
	144 -> CXLIV

Actually, that's all about the assigment. If you have questions, ideas or comments, feel free to contact me using the contact credentials I gave you in the kick-off email. Again, if you are uncertain, ask me a question. My task is to answer you questions, so don't be shy, and ask!

## Expectations
Here is a list about my expectations:

* start your own fork of this project
* create a new file which contains your plan (schedule, backlog, queue, it is up to you which format you use)
* update your plan whenever it is needed. For example, you finished a sub-part of the application
* send me regular pull-requests with your latest code and updates as you progress
* the code you send me should build and work without any additional library or manual configuration
* there have to be test cases so that I can see that your code is working
* use the coding style which is the most convenient for you
* you have one week to do the whole exercise starting after you wrote me back that you read and understood the exercise
